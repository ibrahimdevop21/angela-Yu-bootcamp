# I think I'm an addict

i dont think it's agood practice to keep pushing every shity code i write to git hub repo but i realy like them green boxes and waiting for my coding skill to grow was so boring so i'm just gone push every thing i do from now on no matter what.
# what i've learned today

basic nodeJS and npm 
e.x: npm init
     npm i <pkg name>
